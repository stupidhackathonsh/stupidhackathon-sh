                <p>STUPID SHIT NO ONE NEEDS & TERRIBLE IDEAS HACKATHON SHANGHAI is a hackathon event focusing on the generation of ideas and prototypes that are unusual, unnecessary, impractical, and/or stupid, using the tools and skills students have acquired through their coursework in Interactive Media Arts, Computer Science, or other majors at NYUSH. </p>
                <p>Students attending the event will work individually or in teams of up to 4 over a period of 12 hours to generate such ideas, after which each group will present what they have come up with. The event will end with a celebration of the sheer amount of stupidity generated by the participants throughout the event. </p>
