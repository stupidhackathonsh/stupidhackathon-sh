                    <p>The project is the device worn on the back to allow the user to overcome negativity throughout the day with the help of a certified technician:)Is life happening too quickly in a pandemic? Does everyday feel the same and time slowly reveals itself to be a social construct made to run a (dis)functional society? Is Zoom too tiring and thoughts of how an online video costs you $50k in tuition are making you rethink your life decisions?
                        We can't fix any of those problems but here's some cute cats and dogs.</p>
